# botc-companion

## Setup

Run "yarn install" in both frontend/ and backend/ to install modules and dependencies

## Usage

Static Files have not been made to serve yet, so you must manually run both.

Run yarn start in both frontend/ and backend/ to compile and run the server.

nodejs runs on http://localhost:3001
react runs on http://localhost:3000 and uses the node host as a proxy

## Notes

For the time being make a branch to mess with adding stuff since the environments were a pain in the ass to setup. I can merge when it works
